          I have been learning web development for three years and have been
          working with Reactjs for the last two years. I have a background
          working with computer and networking hardware and have done some small
          scale web development for local non-profits. I also have professional
          experience in management, program development, education, and graphic
          design. I'm currently looking for a position that will allow me to
          share and develop my skills as a web developer and software engineer.
